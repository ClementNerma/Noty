# Noty

**Noty** is a lightweight text editor that aims to be halfway between a simple notepad and a complete IDE.

The philosophy of Noty is to be as fast and as minimal as possible. This means there isn't any IntelliSense-like feature, no integrated build tools, no file hierarchy manager, nothing like that. Instead, all you have is a simple but complete editor.

The features of Noty are as follow:

- Blazing fast to start
- Extremely fast to load (stays in background by default)
- Minimal but fully functional interface
- Syntax highlighting for 150+ programming languages
- Fully-packed editor with automatic parenthesis/braces/brackets closing and matching
- Customizable keymaps
- Tabs
- Auto-saves, including Untitled files
